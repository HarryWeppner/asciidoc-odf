Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>

The ODF backend for AsciiDoc enables AsciiDoc users to directly convert
documents from AsciiDoc to ODT 1.1.

== Benefits
The ODF backend provides the following benefits:

 - styled and formatted using LibreOffice/OpenOffice

 - saving and re-applying styles during processing

 - converting to various formats supported by LibreOffice/OpenOffice
   export plugins (incl. PDF, DOC, HTML, ...)

== Limitations
The current implementation is not feature complete. We are working on
it and your help in testing and feedback is appreciated.
