== Slide 1 title

Slide 1 is arguably the most important slide of your deck.

Therefor it is important to grab the attention of the audience, by:

- using blink in your slides
- adding a funny animation
- adding a fart sound
- shouting really loud
- playing dead


== Slide 2 title

The second slide is less important, and therefor can be removed.

But in case you want to keep it, add some silly enumerations:

1. Look funny
2. Mumble something
3. Do a silly walk
4. Undress
5. Dance the lambada for 10 seconds
6. Leave the building


== Slide 3 title

Slide 3 usually adds a graph, chart or some source code:

[code,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.txt; do
    stat --printf="%s %n" $file
done | sort -d
----
