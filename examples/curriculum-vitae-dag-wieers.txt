.Availability and work interests
****************************************************************************
My technical experience and interests as a system engineer and system
architect focus on Linux and Open Source software, preferably Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux. With more than
{linux-experience} years of experience I am one of the Linux pioneers
in Belgium and well-known within the specific Red Hat Linux community.

Skills include deploying, migrating and managing Linux infrastructure
(servers and desktops), packaging Unix software, designing and
implementing system tools, improving hardware support and automating
operational tasks using python, shell scripting and perl with attention
to documentation, standardization, procedures and policies.

I am available as a freelancer for contract work inside and outside of
Europe, but not willing to relocate on a permanent basis.
