This document is meant for testing the AsciiDoc ODF backend and highlighting
known problems to developers. The output of this document, using the default
ODF stylesheet should match the HTML output as close as possible.

.Quote block
[quote, Dag Wieers, Emails since 1995]
Any errors in spelling, tact or fact
are transmission errors.

.Verse block
[verse, William Blake, from Auguries of Innocence]
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

== Formatting
A paragraph can have differently formatted text, like *strong* text,
_emphasized_ text or +monospaced+ text. But also `quoted', ``double-quoted'',
^superscript^ and ~subscript~ are possibilities.

And a anchor:formatting[referenced] paragraph.

== Admonitions

[WARNING]
There is a dragon reading over your shoulder !

[CAUTION]
Reading beyond this line may breach your contract.

[IMPORTANT]
Don't forget to drink coffee on a *regular* basis.

[NOTE]
Do not believe everything that is written in this document.

[TIP]
====
Throw away everything you already now and think out of the box.

.Bulleted lists are possible
* As you can see
* Bullets can be
* Part of a block

== References
It is not uncommon to create <<formatting,references>> to other parts of a
document. Here are some <<tables,tests>>.

== Footnotes
This is a simple footnote
footnote:[A footnote is a note in the footer]
test. Obviously you can have more than one footnote
footnote:[A second footnote is possible] in a document.

You can also create footnote references
footnoteref:[footnote,A footnote reference is just like a footnote, but with a reference ID in it].

// This fails to work
And then create a reference to an earlier footnote
footnoteref:[footnote] somewhere else in your text.
