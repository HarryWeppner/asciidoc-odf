== Formatting
A paragraph can have differently formatted text, like *strong* text,
_emphasized_ text or +monospaced+ text. But also `quoted', ``double-quoted'',
^superscript^ and ~subscript~ are possibilities.

And a anchor:formatting[referenced] paragraph.

== Admonitions

[WARNING]
There is a dragon reading over your shoulder !

[CAUTION]
Reading beyond this line may breach your contract.

[IMPORTANT]
Don't forget to drink coffee on a *regular* basis.

[NOTE]
Do not believe everything that is written in this document.

[TIP]
====
Throw away everything you already now and think out of the box.

.Bulleted lists are possible
* As you can see
* Bullets can be
* Part of a block
====

== References
It is not uncommon to create <<formatting,references>> to other parts of a
document. Here are some <<tables,tests>>.

== Footnotes
This is a simple footnote
footnote:[A footnote is a note in the footer]
test. Obviously you can have more than one footnote
footnote:[A second footnote is possible] in a document.

You can also create footnote references
footnoteref:[footnote,A footnote reference is just like a footnote, but with a reference ID in it].

// This fails to work
And then create a reference to an earlier footnote
footnoteref:[footnote] somewhere else in your text.
