This document is meant for testing the AsciiDoc ODF backend and highlighting
known problems to developers. The output of this document, using the default
ODF stylesheet should match the HTML output as close as possible.

== Paragraph
First paragraph is here.

And this is the second paragraph.

== Formatting
A paragraph can have differently formatted text, like *strong* text,
_emphasized_ text or +monospaced+ text. But also `quoted', ``double-quoted'',
^superscript^ and ~subscript~ are possibilities.

And a anchor:formatting[referenced] paragraph.

== References
It is not uncommon to create <<formatting,references>> to other parts of a
document. Here are some <<tables,tests>>.

== Footnotes
This is a simple footnote
footnote:[A footnote is a note in the footer]
test. Obviously you can have more than one footnote
footnote:[A second footnote is possible] in a document.

You can also create footnote references
footnoteref:[footnote,A footnote reference is just like a footnote, but with a reference ID in it].

// This fails to work
And then create a reference to an earlier footnote
footnoteref:[footnote] somewhere else in your text.

== Comments and annotations

[annotation,dag,2011-12-03]
